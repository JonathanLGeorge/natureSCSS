/*
why 62.5%??? because wewant to use rems, and 10px is a good base for using rems
the 62.5 comes from the standard web browser value of 16px. So we convert the defualt font size
to be 62.5% of 16px which is really 10px. now everything can scale according to settings the user selects
from their browser settings, and everything will translate as we expect
